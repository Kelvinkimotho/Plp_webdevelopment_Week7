# CSS3 Transitions, Animations, and Advanced JavaScript Functions

## Objectives
- Create smooth CSS transitions and animations.  
- Use JavaScript functions for dynamic behavior.  
- Implement local storage for data persistence.  
- Allow theme switching between Light and Dark modes with persistence.

## Solution Overview

âœ… Built a **neon-themed page** with buttons and animated elements.  
âœ… Implemented a **theme switcher** (Light Mode / Dark Mode) using JavaScript and `localStorage` to remember the user's preference.  
âœ… Added a **"pulse" animation** to a neon box, triggered dynamically when clicking a button.

### Main Features
- **Theme Switching**  
  Users can toggle between light and dark themes. The selected theme is saved using `localStorage`, so the preference persists even after page reloads.

- **Dynamic Animation**  
  Clicking the "Click Me!" button toggles a **pulsing neon animation** on a square element.

- **Local Storage**  
  User's selected theme preference is saved in their browser locally.

- **Clean UI and Responsive Design**  
  Neon effects with smooth transitions for a visually striking appearance.
